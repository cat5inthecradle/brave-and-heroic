    The cockpit is a small room with two seats and a control panel. A large
    window looks out into space, revealing a planet below. There are exits back
    to the Crew Quarters, and up to the Gunnery Bay. A small ceramic rooster
    sits on the control panel.

  detail: |
    The gunnery bay is a cramped single seat turret on the top of the ship. A
    domed window looks out into space. As this is the closest thing to a private
    space you have on the ship, a few of your personal effect decorate the room.
    You can see the cockpit below.
