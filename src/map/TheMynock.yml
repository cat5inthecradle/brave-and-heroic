  detail: |
    The gunnery bay is a cramped single seat turret on the top of the ship. A
    domed window looks out into space. As this is the closest thing to a private

      detail: |
        The 5-year-old Zabrak child is sleeping quietly in his bunk. The way his
        head is turned, you can't see the fresh tattoos on half of his face - a
        Dathomiran ritual that was interrupted when you rescued him. He looks
        peaceful, but exhausted and sore from your escape from the Emperor's
        Murder Ball. You should let him rest.

    The kitchen is a small room with a counter and a few cabinets. A small
    booth sits along the starboard wall. The decor is... kitchy, to say the

    forward end of the room opens to the crew quarters. Leenik is frantically
    trying to open the door to one of the escape pods.
