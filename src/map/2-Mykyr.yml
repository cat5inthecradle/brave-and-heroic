# it's springtime
# Tryst is wearing a floral kimono
# you have plenty of boring rations
# spot movement in the lake
#   don't get eaten by a lake monster
# We have scout probes (flip lightside)
#   "i have found a planet"
#   "i am scanning the planet now"
# in the escape pod
#   lawn chair, blender
# in kitchen
#   limes, space-tequila
# laundry
#   bacta tells us to change clothes so he can do laundry
#   this is when you get to wear your iconic outfit.
#   leenik boxers with hearts
# Tamlin comes down the ramp, "where are we? why are we camping? aren't we hiding?"
#   Bacta explains history of Mykyr, Tamlin sits by Tamlin and teaches him how to wash clothes (at lake?)
# Tryst and Leenik paint the ship
#   light up a deathstick, paint ignites, have to run to the lake to douse yourself
#   don't get eaten by lake monster
# 8pm, sunset
# tamlin medidates
# tryst says we shouldn't lie to Tamlin, tell him what's up
#   watched him almost kill you, bacta
#   remember that bacta is 17
#   Scary wolf howl
#   leenik: we can leave him somewhere safe
#   bacta: we should let him choose his own adventure ;)
#   should someone keep watch? Bacta will keep watch because he doesn't sleep
#   if he wears his helmet, he can see somewhat in the dark
#   tamlin is meditating, fallen asleep? carry him inside
#   something happens, you don't know what it is
#   bring the lawn chair inside
# in the evening
#   some 4-legged black creature skulking around, looking at the ship
#     can take a warning shot if you peek out hatch, if you go out, another creature should attack you
#   warning shot makes it leave
#   you see some movement, mountain-side, possibly multiple
# "Good morning everyone"
#   can make powdered eggs
#   Tryst rises early, kimono
#   Leenik slept in the escape pod, footie pajamas
# "eggs, bacon, caff, gimme the special"
# talk about fuel, just need a place to jump
# "a cleverl intelligent species knows we're here and is stalking us"
# "creatures on this planet that are in tune with the force"
# try to keep Tryst covered?
# probe droid is still functionin, no news
# check maps to figure out a planet to go to
#   could go to Plue (not enough fuel) or Wayland (not good planet) or talk to Kardas here
#   can we trust Kardas
# "we could have just one of us contact Kardas, so we don't all get captured"
# "what if we get captured on purpose"
#   "high risk, high reward", "what is the reward? it's all risk"
# "kardas knows that the empire wants us, but that means we must have something the empire wants, Kardas would want to know what that is"
# "smugglers always want the bigger score, there's gotta be something he wants"
#   maybe he wants a clean break from the empire?
#   a bunch of the cargo that they stole from the empire came from Kardas, you could learn something about him and his interactions with the empire
# Quest - search the info
# Tamlin - the force feels weird, can't feel the force in the forest

# d20 is repairing himself slowly
